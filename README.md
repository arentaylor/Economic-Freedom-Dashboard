# Economic Freedom Dashboard

For this assignment, I used a new data source. The Economic Freedom Index from the Heritage Foundation examines 12 quantitative and qualitative measures, grouped into the categories of: 
Rule of Law, Government Size, Open Markets, and Regulatory Efficiency.

The measures are scored from 0 to 100, and the overall economic freedom score is derived from averaging the twelve measures, with each given an equal weight. For the 2019 index, the report covers the second half of 2017 and the first half of 2018.

The visualizations I included are:

* Average Score By Region
* The Top 20 Countries
* Overall Economic Freedom Score Compared to:
    * Property Rights
    * Judicial Effectiveness
    * Financial Freedom
    * Business Freedom
